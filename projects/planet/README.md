# Full Planet Build

This project is configured to download/prepare/build a complete Pelias installation for the entire planet.

### Requirements:
~600GB Disk
~16GB RAM
16+ CPU cores or a lot of patience

## Setup

Please refer to the instructions at https://github.com/pelias/docker in order to install and configure your docker environment.

The minimum configuration required in order to run this project are [installing prerequisites](https://github.com/pelias/docker#prerequisites), [install the pelias command](https://github.com/pelias/docker#installing-the-pelias-command) and [configure the environment](https://github.com/pelias/docker#configure-environment).

Please ensure that's all working fine before continuing.

### Caveats

A full planet build will require a street polylines file generated with Valhalla. Please see [the documentation](https://github.com/pelias/polylines/wiki/Generating-polylines-from-Valhalla) on how to perform that build.

## Run a Build

To run a complete build, execute the following commands:

```bash
pelias compose pull
pelias elastic start
pelias elastic wait
pelias elastic create
pelias download all
pelias prepare all
pelias import all
pelias compose up
pelias test run
```
